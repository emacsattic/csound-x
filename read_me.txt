Installation:
-------------

It is highly recommended to install all code from the stef-elisp archive (see the READ_ME.txt file): 

  unpack the stef-elisp.zip archive in your ~/site-lisp directory
  then write the following in your .emacs and evaluate it: 
        
  (require 'stef-elisp)


that's it !
